<p>This awesome wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout screening, we found it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly triggering when motion was detected. We like that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey.
