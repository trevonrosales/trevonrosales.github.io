<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a malicious assaulter, given that the interruption of the network prevents the flow of information and in fact indirectly safeguards information by avoiding it from being sent. The normal reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing a chance for the destructive assailant to tape-record these codes and use various splitting tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can launch a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based on the "design" security key recorded during the network recovery.</p>
