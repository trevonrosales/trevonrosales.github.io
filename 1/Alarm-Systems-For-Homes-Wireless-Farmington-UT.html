<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment this way to make customers stay with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies implies hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for customers. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
