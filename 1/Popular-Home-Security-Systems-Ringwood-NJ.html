<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the whole family will enjoy. How much bandwidth your camera uses depends on many aspects. A few of the considerations include image resolution and whether your camera records everything or only clips set off by motion or sound. Home security systems are a one-time investment that can settle, huge time, down the line. Does the ideal system have all the whistles and bells, from facial recognition to floodlights? Not necessarily. You'll desire cameras with strong basics: reliable, good image quality, and simple to operate.
