<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the obligation of the whole community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you plan to save and for how long you prepare to keep taped video. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage when you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not mindful, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>
<p>Notifies: Home security cameras press notifications to your mobile phone when they spot events. Without watching the live feed all day, this is the only way to keep tabs on your home in relative real time. Depending on the camera, it may send text signals when it finds motion, noise, a face (unrecognized or known), or all three. Some can send out alerts to multiple people, normally anyone else in the household using that item's app; others will send out emails in addition to text messages as a failsafe in case you can't access your mobile device.</p>
