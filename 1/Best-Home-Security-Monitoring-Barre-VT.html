The $260 Fundamentals bundle includes the base station, a keypad, 4 entry sensors, one motion sensing unit, a yard sign, and two window decals. For $15 per month, you can add 24/7 professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive plan adds control through iOS and Android mobile phone apps, push and email alerts, and 30-day event-footage storage for unrestricted cameras, consisting of the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is offered independently. Without the $25 strategy, you deal with all controls via the keypad.</p>
<p>Buying equipment is easier with SimpliSafe than with ADT monitoring through SafeStreets. With SimpliSafe, you can buy whatever online without making telephone call or having a back-and-forth.
