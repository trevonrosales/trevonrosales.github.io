<p>Discover how to create, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and minimize crime. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensor to be touchy, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.

Basically, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud.
