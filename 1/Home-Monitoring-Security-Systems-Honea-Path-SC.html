The equipment's all offered by 3rd parties, so what you receive might be from a different manufacturer than the equipment your next-door neighbor received. Why's that? ADT uses an independent distributor model involving third-party dealers. The dealers figure out which equipment to use. Expenses for systems vary.

The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve information after the truth, which implies that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it likewise brings with it some downsides. 4K images are very large and use up a lot of tape-recording storage space. So much, in reality, that they require about four times the hard disk drive space of 1080p to tape the exact same length of video footage.
