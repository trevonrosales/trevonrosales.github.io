Nevertheless, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next.

These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is truly terrific. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
