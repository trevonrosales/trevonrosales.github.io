<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you need extra cable televisions.
