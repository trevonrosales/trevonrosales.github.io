In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

<p>We also like that Ring still has good clever home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with smart home gadgets like locks and lights. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can integrate your wise outlets with your general security system. With the advances in technology, monitoring a home security system is fairly simple.
