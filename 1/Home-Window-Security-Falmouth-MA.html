<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
