<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you stroll by.
