We've discovered good deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, but you'll discover more than 30 brands available. Sometimes you don't have an option. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT provide just expert installation. However most other companies on our best home security systems list provide you a DIY alternative. ADT doesn't have the strongest customer support track record amongst the companies we considered, racking up more than 3,000 problems on its Bbb page While we chalked most of this as much as the reality that ADT has several million more customers than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>

Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its promise of up to one year of battery life.
