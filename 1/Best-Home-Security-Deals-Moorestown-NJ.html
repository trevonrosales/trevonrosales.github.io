It's compact, versatile, and works very well - the Canary app is easy to work your way around and lets you adjust the level of sensitivity of the motion detection, so you're not continuously getting disturbed with signals.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later on produced to deal with the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
