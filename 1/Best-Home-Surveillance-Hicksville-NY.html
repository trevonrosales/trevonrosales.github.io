<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound changes to the character of our public spaces. When people are being seen by the authorities - or conscious they may be enjoyed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "understanding that you are being watched by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "individuals might find out to be cautious about the books and regulars they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, members or druggies." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain found that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>
