<h3>New Alarm Systems For Homes in Birdsboro PA</h3>
<p>so say you have a camera that somebody can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I advise to have cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras provide an obvious indication for anyone who goes by that they are being taped on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and criminal offense.

<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
