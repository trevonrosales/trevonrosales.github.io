Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
