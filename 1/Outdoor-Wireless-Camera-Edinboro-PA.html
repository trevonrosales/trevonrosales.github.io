If alarm usage resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less robberies throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize police action to alarmed properties) a inefficient and pricey approach to theft reduction throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
