<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the entire household will love. ADT is a household name, so we frequently experiment with their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task. In our latest round of testing, we realized that ADT is the most popular provider for a factor. We think their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with nifty clever home functions. We particularly liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>

We called customer assistance, which provided a complimentary replacement system-- even though the service warranty had actually long considering that ended.</p>
<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We must note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
