<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, fraud, and vandalism. Idea: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again respond to the alarm; each action is billed.

For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it immediately switch off the heating systems.
