<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensors, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
