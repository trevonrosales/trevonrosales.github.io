<p>Another crucial topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand how much suffices. In this short article, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image. The exact same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much picture information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it pertains to surveillance cameras, there are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
