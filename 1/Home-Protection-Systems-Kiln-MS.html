Many insurer provide discounts on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm systems.

However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
