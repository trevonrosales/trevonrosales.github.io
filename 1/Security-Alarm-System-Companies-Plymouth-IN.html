As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
