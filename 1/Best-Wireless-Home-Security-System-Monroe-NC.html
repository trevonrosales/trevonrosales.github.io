"When the criminal offense and offence figures were gotten used to appraise the basic downward pattern in offenses and criminal offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "decreases were noted in particular classifications but there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had actually decreased criminal offense overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Office likewise found that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 study, also for the British federal government).</p>
