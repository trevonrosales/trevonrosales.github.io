You can normally fine-tune the camera's motion sensitivity to prevent incorrect alarms due to animal activity or passing cars and trucks if the camera is near a window, and you can develop a schedule that turns the sensing units on and off during specific hours of the day.</p>

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential offenders are less most likely to devote crime if they think they are being viewed or have a greater danger of being captured.

This suggests that the culprit must be aware of the added surveillance for it to attain its desired impact.</p>
