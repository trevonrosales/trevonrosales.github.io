<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.

Here's a take a look at Vivint security cameras for indoor and outdoor surveillance. Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later on. The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These people are $18 a month less expensive and been in business three decades so I'm comfortable providing a shot.

Due to the fact that it does not have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Unfortunately I purchased 4 cameras that look just like these, thinking I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Boy was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is really fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
