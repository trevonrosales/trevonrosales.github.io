As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.

Here's a take a look at Vivint security cameras for indoor and outdoor surveillance. Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later on. The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company.
