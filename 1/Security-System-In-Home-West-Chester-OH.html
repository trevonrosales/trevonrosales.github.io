<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>We looked for DIY systems that used expert monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies offer free or heavily reduced hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most versatile. Some people might want to sign up for service only for when they or their partner runs out town, for instance. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and enable you to be in overall control of the equipment you utilize, as well as how and when you utilize and pay for monitoring services.</p>
