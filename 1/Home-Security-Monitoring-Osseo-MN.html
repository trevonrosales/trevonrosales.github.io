<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
