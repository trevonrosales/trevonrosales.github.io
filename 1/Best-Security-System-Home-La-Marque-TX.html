The answer depends upon a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you plan to store and for how long you plan to keep recorded footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage once you reach the system's capability, however if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>
