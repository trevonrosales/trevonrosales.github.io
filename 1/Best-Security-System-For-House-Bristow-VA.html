<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
