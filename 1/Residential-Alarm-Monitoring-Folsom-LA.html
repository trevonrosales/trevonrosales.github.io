However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have extra sensors and essential fobs, too.</p>
