<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should carry a share of the cost. If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer robberies across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to police capability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund cops action to alarmed properties) a expensive and ineffective  method to robbery reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Worth noting: you can also get an outdoor version (₤ 199.99, Amazon) which is essentially the same however with a range added functions.
