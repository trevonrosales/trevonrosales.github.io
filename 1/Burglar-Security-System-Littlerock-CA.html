<p>Though most of our attention these days is concentrated on the shift to IP video technology, it is very important to note that analog CCTV security cameras can still be highly reliable for numerous surveillance applications, particularly those on a budget plan. With conventional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transferred in analog format for local seeing from one main monitoring place. But that does not mean you can't utilize analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment.
