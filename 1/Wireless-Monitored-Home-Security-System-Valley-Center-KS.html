The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly evolved into the highly advanced yet affordable systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape video and watch it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
<p>In its truest form, a CCTV camera is an analog video camera that transfers signals via coaxial cable to a single central area for recording, monitoring, and video analysis.
