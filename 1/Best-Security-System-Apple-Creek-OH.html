<h3>Automated Home Security in Ohio</h3>
<p>Because it's more complicated than it should be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all require different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

<p>While monitored systems are more detailed and do the majority of the work for you, an unmonitored system depends on someone accountable (we're looking at you) to help do a few of the work. You can generally install these systems by yourself, and they are much, much more economical. Also, there's no worry of entering an agreement you can't get away when you need to. The financial independence alone makes this choice better for some households. In addition, most unmonitored security systems will send alerts to your smart device, making it simple to know if there's a threat to your property.</p>
