<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
