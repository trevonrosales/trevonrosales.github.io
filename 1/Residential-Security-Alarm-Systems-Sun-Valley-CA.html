<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF certified, which suggests you can use numerous different third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera deal with other ONVIF-compliant gadgets.

That method when a door is opened, or a camera is passed by, you will be alerted. Normally, the bullet CCTV camera type is small, which might be 2.5 to 3 inches long chosen by the CCTV camera lens types. So they are simpler to conceal and are less visible if you put it properly.</p>
