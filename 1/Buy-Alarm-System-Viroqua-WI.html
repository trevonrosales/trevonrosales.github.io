The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
