<p>This clever clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout screening, we found it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly activating when movement was spotted. We like that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get costly. It's also worth keeping in mind that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
