Considering that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to by hand stop notices (and recording, because it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connection problems, with two Hive test units detaching 8 times over 2 months. Scout is really simple to utilize, specifically if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based internet browsers, and it allows you to manage nearly every aspect of the security system from another location, and it's highly personalized. Inside the app, you can even manage e-mail subscriptions, SMS alerts, or the in-app notifications.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the maker's statistics because this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest culprit for short battery life without a doubt.

<p>You can choose from SimpliSafe's original award-winning system or their newest line of equipment. Both systems offer impressive, dependable home security. With the newer system, you will pay more, but that higher cost includes a system that is smaller, quicker, and more powerful.
