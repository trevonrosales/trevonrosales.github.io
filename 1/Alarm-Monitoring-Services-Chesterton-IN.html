<p>The real factor cameras are typically deployed is to decrease much pettier criminal offenses. However it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly deployed in public places, sociologists studying the issue have actually discovered that they have actually not decreased criminal activity. "As soon as the criminal offense and offence figures were adapted to appraise the general downward trend in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "decreases were noted in particular categories but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had reduced criminal activity overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the fear of criminal activity (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>
