<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick description of how thermal cameras work: All objects give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy released by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it releases. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of detecting small distinctions in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from items in the scene and develops an electronic image based on information about the temperature level distinctions. Because things are seldom precisely the exact same temperature level as other items around them, a thermal camera can spot them, and they will look like distinct in a thermal image.</p>
