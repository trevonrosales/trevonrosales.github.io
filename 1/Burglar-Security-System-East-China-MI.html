<h3>Install Security System East China MI 48054</h3>
<p>There are 2 main types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet procedure (IP) cameras and the standard analog cameras. IP cameras are the more contemporary iteration of analog cameras, and while the individual cameras tend to be a bit more pricey, they use a number of features that analog cameras do not.
