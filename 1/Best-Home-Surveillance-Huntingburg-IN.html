IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
