We likewise experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over 2 months. Scout is very simple to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile phones.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
