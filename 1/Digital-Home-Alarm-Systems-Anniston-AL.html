Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
