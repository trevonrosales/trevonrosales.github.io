The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall.
