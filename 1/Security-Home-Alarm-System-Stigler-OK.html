<p>While all strategies come with the Frontpoint app, to open video surveillance and advanced smart tech features, you'll need its $50-per-month Ultimate strategy. That's a high rate for home automation when compared to competitors like Vivint, which lets you include those features at every tier (starting at $40 per month).

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
