<p>Home security must never be restricted by where you can put or power your cameras, inside your home or outdoors.

<p>Consider it in this manner, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more sophisticated video camera be cost the low price of forty dollars? It simply does not build up. To provide such low prices, producers need to cut corners, and completion result is compromised efficiency. What good is a surveillance camera that only works preferably in ideal conditions like intense sunshine?

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great alternative for long range situations where trees and poles are not present.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are utilized, the quality is going to be poor since the optimum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the outcomes are the exact same); they normally record vertical and horizontal fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
