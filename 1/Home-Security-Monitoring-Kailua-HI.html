<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
