We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were frequently missing, despite showing up in the app's activity timeline.

After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost 6 months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its promise of approximately one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have seen some improvements since the camera's launch, and will continue to evaluate and update this evaluation, as required.</p>
