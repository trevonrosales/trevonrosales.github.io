<p>3 big benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their mobility, expandability and impermanence.

Wireless control board, sensing units and other components can quickly be set up at different homes in the future, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new components too. Wireless security plans also allow remote control of the system and general home automation.
