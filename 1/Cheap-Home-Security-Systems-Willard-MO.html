<p>We needed guards for our yearly Coats for the Cold event to protect the line tent and building, keep order in the wee hours of the early morning and to start the heating system at 5am. The very first guard showed up early so he might look at the entire location and speak to me about my concerns. He was professional, considerate and extremely reassuring. The second guard got here in the middle of the night and took over. When I arrived in the early morning to get the event started, he was also professional, encouraging and polite. We were very delighted with your service and I will suggest that we call on your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. As soon as after leaving our residential or commercial property in your hands, I didn't worry.</p>
