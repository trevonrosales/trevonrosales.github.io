As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
