<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras lower criminal offense. HD CCTV systems are compatible with standard analog CCTV cameras. If you bought cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable (look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that means you have conventional analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can update your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax facilities.

In addition to monitoring your home's activity with door sensing units and motion detection, many home security systems likewise support cameras, either inside or outside your home.

An Internet procedure camera is a digital camera that sends and gets information by means of a computer system network. This varies from a CCTV camera, which can just send and get signals through a cable television linked to a DVR.</p>
<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder before buying.</p>
