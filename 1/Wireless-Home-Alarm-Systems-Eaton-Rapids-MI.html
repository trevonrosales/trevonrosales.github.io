IP cameras work by utilizing an IP (IP stands for web protocol) network, frequently the same data network the rest of a company uses. If bandwidth is an issue, a separate network using classification 5 electrical wiring can be used. In any case, video info is recorded on a server, which suggests video information can be located on site or in a remote place. After screening, we sent out each of our top picks, as well as the Wyze Webcam v2, to Costs McKinley, head of information security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's moms and dad company), for hack screening. (Costs is also a self-proclaimed paranoid infosec man.") He assessed each camera for any impressive security flaws and concluded that all of our top choices and the spending plan Wyze Camera passed basic security requirements and securities.</p>
