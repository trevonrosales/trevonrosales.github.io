<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and scams. Tip: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We must once again react to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of costly incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a particular level, you can make it immediately turn off the heating unit. You can instantly make the wise lights turn on to terrify away possible burglars if the motion sensing units are set off.</p>

<p>CCTV cameras are much better at capturing wrongdoers after they have actually committed a crime, instead of being able to stop a criminal offense in progress. Someone needs to be actively viewing the video screens for all 10,000 cameras if they are going to attempt to discover criminal activity before it happens. Having a large number of visible CCTV cameras in public areas may act as some level of deterrent, knowing you are being filmed, though most likely not viewed.</p>
