<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers complimentary benefits like person detection, familiar-face signals, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 monthly.) However, in our tests the familiar-face alerts worked only about half of the time and the camera regularly detached from the network numerous times a day (when whatever else on our network seemed fine).
