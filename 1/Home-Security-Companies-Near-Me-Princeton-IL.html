<h3>Best Wireless Home Security System  in Illinois</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger area and therefore provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular considering that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
