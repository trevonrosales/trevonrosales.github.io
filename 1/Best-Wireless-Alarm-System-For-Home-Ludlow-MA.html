Instead, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you walk by.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally referred to as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.
