<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm, a number of companies provide "totally free monitoring services" for the first few months. Many insurance companies offer discounts on insurance coverage premiums to consumers with operable alarm. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many cops departments provide a number of "free" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to respond is considerable right from the start. The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers call into question the appropriateness of the present pattern in U.S. policing of permitting three or four totally free false alarms per calendar year, because they supply no up-front rewards to encourage owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
<p>To gauge reaction times for the monitoring company, we activated each system a minimum of 5 times, utilizing contact and motion sensors. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security personnel. A number of cities likewise require an authorization to even operate a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are developed to limit the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>

Usually, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is a lot of available light, and once the lighting ends up being low or missing (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree begins to reveal. Because they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adjust and record exceptional low light video, commercial cameras outshine their cheaper cousins.</p>
