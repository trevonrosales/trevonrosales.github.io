This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch.
