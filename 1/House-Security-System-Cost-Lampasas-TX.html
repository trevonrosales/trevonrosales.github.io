<p>This awesome wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During testing, we found it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly activating when movement was found. We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey. It's also worth noting that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it just keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
