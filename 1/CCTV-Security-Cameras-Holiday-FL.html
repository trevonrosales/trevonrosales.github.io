The Area can tape up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline.

<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can manage such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.
