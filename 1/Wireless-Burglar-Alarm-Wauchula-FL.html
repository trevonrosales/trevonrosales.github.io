<p>The loudest of the clever alarm systems we checked, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at cautioning anybody in your home and those close-by that there's a problem. During testing, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we love that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adapted to represent family pets, too. The alarm is just one of 2 we tested that includes an external siren, and we're pleased that it also comes with a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, even more discouraging anybody from trying to break in to your home. We checked Somfy's more costly system, which came with a wifi security camera, however more budget friendly packages are also offered. Despite the significant rate here, there's no external monitoring alternative.</p>
