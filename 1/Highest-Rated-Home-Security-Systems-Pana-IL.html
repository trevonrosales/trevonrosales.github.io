<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over long distances.

Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually through 110VAC power.</p>
