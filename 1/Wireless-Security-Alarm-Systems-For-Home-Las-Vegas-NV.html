<p>Several screens were set up within the new command center with a single monitor appointed to alarm displays. As soon as any alarm system incorporated into the PCU was activated, the closest camera to that area would be displayed on that particular monitor. The opportunity that the repaired camera would be pointed in the direction of the event depends on the initial requirements for area of coverage. If there are three select emergency exits, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single fixed camera can just view one. This creates a one in three opportunity of catching a particular incident on video (either live or tape-recorded).

The main control should be centrally located in your home and have full time non-switched AC power. Wired alarm systems are extremely reputable and you do not need to stress over their battery running out.
