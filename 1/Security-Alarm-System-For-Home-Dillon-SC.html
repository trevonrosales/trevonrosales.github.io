<p>Alarm monitoring is part of a complete home security system.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens.

This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>

Likewise, the wired variation generally left gaps of approximately 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both likewise lack person detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to reduce false notifies.</p>
