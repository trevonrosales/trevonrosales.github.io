<p>Amongst IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the footage from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the web.
