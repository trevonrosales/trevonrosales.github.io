<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
