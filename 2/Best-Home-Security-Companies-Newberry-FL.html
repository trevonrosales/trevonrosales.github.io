<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter occasion alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.
