<p>Many home security systems are controlled by mobile phones and that pattern will continue. Systems will have less wall-mounted keypads, and rather, give more controls to more devices. Wireless door, window, glass break, freeze, water and motion sensors interact with a center or base station in your house. The main control should be centrally located in your house and have full-time non-switched AC power. Wired alarm systems are extremely trustworthy and you do not have to worry about their battery going out. However, they are repaired in location, might require expert installation, and they're not portable.</p>
