<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
