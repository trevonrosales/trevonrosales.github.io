<p>Numerous wireless home security systems are can be installed by the property owner and have a basic setup procedure. However security systems that need a phone line connection are usually advanced and require professional installation by a specialist. That said, we actually liked Brinks' simple package options.

Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
