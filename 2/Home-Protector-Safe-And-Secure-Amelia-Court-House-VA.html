Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
