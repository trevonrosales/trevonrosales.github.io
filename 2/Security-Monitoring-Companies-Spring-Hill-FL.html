The normal reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying a chance for the malicious assailant to tape-record these codes and utilize different cracking tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "model" security essential recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>
