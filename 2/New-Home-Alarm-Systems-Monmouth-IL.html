The rate of false alarms for commercial alarm users may be as much as three times higher than the rate of false alarms amongst residential alarm users. 9 Persistent incorrect alarm activations are frequently due to inadequate employee training or inferior systems that have not been updated.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
