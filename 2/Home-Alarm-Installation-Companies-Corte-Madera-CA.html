<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

ADT Blue is a camera-heavy, DIY variation of the ADT system, and we like its cameras better than the traditional" ADT variations. The camera can record video in approximately 1080p, which looks perfectly great on a smart device screen and will not tax your web connection too much. Netatmo likewise permits you to fine tune the settings for each individual user - for example, don't tape-record Abbie, but do record Ben. It's in fact quite smart.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
