<p>All About Security provides expert, reputable alarm monitoring services for homes and services throughout the higher Indianapolis area. Whether you own or rent, you desire the best security camera system for watching on your home while you're gone.

<p>Some wireless security companies have additional features and plans for an included cost. If you  want to have constant video recording and cloud storage for your security cameras, you'll have to pay a annual or monthly fee. Many of these offers do not consist of an agreement, but some may require a contract for the equipment or expert monitoring services. For instance, Scout only provides one security camera (and it's for indoor use just). If you desire a few more sets of eyes on your residential or commercial property, though, Scout Alarm integrates with Nest Cams, which can send out motion notices to your Scout app.</p>

You can usually fine-tune the camera's motion sensitivity to avoid incorrect alarms due to pet activity or passing cars if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensing units on and off during certain hours of the day.</p>
<p>Motion sensors provide backup protection in case a burglar manages to get into your home. But they only run when you're out of the house. Don't think they'll protect you if somebody enters when you're sleeping! Quite the opposite, your alarm system in fact neglects motion sensing unit signals if you arm the system but stay home.
