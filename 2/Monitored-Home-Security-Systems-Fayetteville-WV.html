<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management solutions for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping others, hotels, and centers. IP cameras work by using an IP (IP stands for internet procedure) network, often the same information network the rest of a company utilizes. A different network utilizing category 5 electrical wiring can be used if bandwidth is a problem. In either case, video information is taped on a server, which indicates video data can be located on website or in a remote area. After screening, we sent each of our top choices, along with the Wyze Cam v2, to Expense McKinley, head of details security at The New york city Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack testing. (Bill is also a self-proclaimed paranoid infosec man.") He assessed each camera for any impressive security flaws and concluded that all of our top picks and the budget Wyze Web cam passed basic security standards and protections.</p>
<p>Though most of our attention nowadays is concentrated on the transition to IP video technology, it is essential to keep in mind that analog CCTV security cameras can still be highly effective for lots of surveillance applications, specifically those on a budget. With traditional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transferred in analog format for local viewing from one main monitoring place. But that doesn't mean you can't use analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Using IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to utilize your existing analog cameras while moving into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

Having a large number of visible CCTV cameras in public areas may function as some level of deterrent, understanding you are being filmed, though most likely not seen.</p>
<p>Analog security cameras transfer lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.
