<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
