<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
