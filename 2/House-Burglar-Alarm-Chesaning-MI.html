The video is going to consume up storage area quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video when you reach the system's capability, but if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>
<p>Frame rate: This is another essential element of a camera-- the higher the frame rate, the smoother the video. Video is merely a series of still images stitched together to develop a movie.
