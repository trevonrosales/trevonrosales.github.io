<p>Another important topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much suffices. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much photo details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some difficult effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
