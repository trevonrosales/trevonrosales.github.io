<p>Do-it-yourself home security companies aren't like the ADTs and Vivints of the world. Instead of locking you into a multiyear agreement with a broad coverage-based regular monthly cost, many Do It Yourself systems provide you the versatility to chose how and when you monitor your home.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer.

Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
