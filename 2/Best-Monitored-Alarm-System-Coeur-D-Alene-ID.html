<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
