<h2>Wifi & Wireless Security Camera Systems For Home & Office Use Latta</h2>

<p>Video and image feeds have proved indispensable for surveillance - but there's room for more performance by using audio. Humans have 5 senses that jointly allow us to precisely range our environment. Therefore, it only makes sense that a security system that engages as lots of senses as possible is more effective.

Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.
