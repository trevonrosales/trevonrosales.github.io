For example, if a motion detector trips in one location, the signal is tape-recorded and the central-station monitor alerts the customer.

<p>Because it's more complicated than it must be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
