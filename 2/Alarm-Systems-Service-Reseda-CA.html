<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.

Numerous recent outdoor Wi-Fi cameras use assistance for IFTTT (If This Then That), an internet service that uses small programs (applets) that you develop to have the camera communicate with other IFTTT-enabled devices.
