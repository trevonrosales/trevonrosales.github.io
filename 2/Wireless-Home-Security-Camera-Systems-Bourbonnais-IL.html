<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a fantastic security camera and a phenomenal value. It gets an Exceptional rating for video quality and is easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep footage locally on an SD card.
