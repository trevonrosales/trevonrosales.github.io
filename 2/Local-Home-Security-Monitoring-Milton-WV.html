<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the specific same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm.
