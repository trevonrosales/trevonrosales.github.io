<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you walk by.
