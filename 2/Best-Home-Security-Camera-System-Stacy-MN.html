<p>Discover how to develop, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and minimize criminal offense. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensor to be touchy, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, and so we might review this evaluation. Basically, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video to the cloud. The broad face of the camera offers you an impressive field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the better it gets, the more information you'll use to save it to the cloud.)
