<h3>Security Alarm Monitoring in Hercules CA</h3>
<p>Unmonitored alarm systems do not connect to expert monitoring. Instead, they sound an alarm to let you understand there is an issue and then permits you to do something about it.

<p>The Hive View provides fantastic 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting.

We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with two Hive test units disconnecting 8 times over two months.
