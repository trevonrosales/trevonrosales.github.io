You'll have three alternatives to select from, which vary from basic intrusion protection to full-on intrusion protection + home automation + video surveillance. We truly enjoyed using Brinks' video features, and we like how their top-tier bundle comes with an HD video doorbell for good measure.</p>

<p>TP-Link's Kasa Camera Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of view that could measure up to a few of our top picks. It also comes with two days of totally free cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can cram in clips of up to 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control board and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. When making a choice, they are the only company of the 4 pointed out that uses a mix of wired and wireless technology so keep that in mind.</p>
