The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
