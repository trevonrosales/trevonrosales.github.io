<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
