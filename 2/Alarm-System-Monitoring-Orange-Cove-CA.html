<p>Discover how to develop, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and lower criminal offense. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensor to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.
