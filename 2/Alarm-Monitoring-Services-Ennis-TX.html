<p>Video and image feeds have actually proved vital for surveillance - however there's space for more functionality by utilizing audio. People have five senses that collectively permit us to accurately vary our environment. For that reason, it only makes sense that a security system that engages as numerous senses as possible is more effective.

These cards are fairly cheap, but inevitably the resulting digital signals are compressed 5:1 (MPEG compression) in order for the video recordings to be minimized a constant basis.</p>
