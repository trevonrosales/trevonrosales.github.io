Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
