Outdoor cameras are one of the very best ways to prevent (and catch) intruders, vandals, and other miscreants.

<p>Analog security cameras send lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.
