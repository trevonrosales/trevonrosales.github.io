Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you get in the WiFi information of the network you're trying to link to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to send the WiFi details. (You must play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pet dogs shout, cats shriek, infants weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
