<h3>Outdoor Home Security Cameras in Michigan</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool features in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving objects if it discovers an intruder; a helpful intercom function that enables the gadget to serve as a clever doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, given that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.
