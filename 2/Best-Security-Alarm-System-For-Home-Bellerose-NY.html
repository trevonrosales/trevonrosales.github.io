That being said, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism since of their apparent appearance. In addition, the shape of the camera is ideal for focusing on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, however requires numerous cameras if a user needs to see multiple fixed views.

For an additional layer of security, search for a camera with sound detection that can let you understand if somebody is out there even if they run out range of the camera lens and the motion sensor.
