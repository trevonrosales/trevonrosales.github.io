<p>The Network Video Recorder, also known as the NVR, is another vital aspect to any IP camera system. Connected to the same IP network, the NVR can be installed practically throughout your building or home. The NVR allows you to tape-record and store video on a hard disk drive, snap images and transmit them to your computer system or remote gadget for documented and live watching.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

<p>Another crucial topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video photo; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The very same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some challenging consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
