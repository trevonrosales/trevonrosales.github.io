'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom might not do. They could peer inside of windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing enjoying outside a window it could be a criminal activity, yet the exact same person could put a surveillance camera then from another location see a person within the personal privacy of their home.
