<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
