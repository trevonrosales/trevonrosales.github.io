If you want to watch a large area, you ought to think about a camera with a really large field of view. The capability to mechanically pan and tilt the camera is an excellent asset as well.</p>

<p>For the most part, wireless security equipment is just as noticeable as you want it to be. Window sensing units are easily concealed behind blinds or drapes, and door sensors are so small that they tend to blend into the doorframe. You can hide a wireless camera much easier than you can one with wires. If you desire home security that mixes into your design and doesn't accentuate itself, then wireless is the much better choice.
