The very first guard showed up early so he could look at the whole area and talk to me about my concerns. He was expert, courteous and extremely reassuring. The 2nd guard showed up in the middle of the night and took over. When I got here in the morning to get the occasion started, he was also professional, considerate and comforting. We were really happy with your service and I will suggest that we get in touch with your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep.
