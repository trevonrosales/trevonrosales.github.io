<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
