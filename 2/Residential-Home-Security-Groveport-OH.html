Here is what this indicates, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
