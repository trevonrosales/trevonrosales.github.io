<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not require a new keypad. Utilizing numerous sensing units to monitor activity in one location, software analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector trips in one location, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor alerts the customer.

<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, covering a number of decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems readily available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape-record video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
