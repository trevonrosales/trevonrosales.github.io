<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, due to the fact that it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>

Which's what Nest provides you.</p>
<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated appearances and face recognition software application.
