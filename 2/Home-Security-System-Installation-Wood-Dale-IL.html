<p>Honeywell's DIY security system depends on a device called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like device with a camera on top. It acts as the brains of the system, getting in touch with sensing units and 3rd party-devices by means of Z-Wave and controlling them using the app or voice control. Another area where Arlo excels is customer care.
