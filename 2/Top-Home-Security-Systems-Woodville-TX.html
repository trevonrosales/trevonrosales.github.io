<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level.

HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
