<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment by doing this to make customers stay with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies suggests numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for consumers. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
