<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood ought to carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer burglaries across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. However, the fact that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to cops ability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund cops reaction to alarmed properties) a expensive and inefficient  approach to burglary decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>

Flood lights can prevent vandals or scare them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your comfort than for home protection.</p>
