<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

It can be controlled remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control board (also referred to as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capacity to pair with other wise devices and can not be controlled remotely.
