<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it must be. Recordings, informs, and combination all require different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
