<p>Most of the cameras we checked need an AC outlet, so positioning is absolutely an element. A few designs use batteries, making placement more flexible, however this needs other trade-offs, which we highlight in the Competition area. Wi-Fi coverage also impacts where you position a camera: If you want to put a camera in a spot that does not get a good Wi-Fi signal, think about updating your router or adding an extender or repeater. (For a take a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for Most People)" and The Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good guideline that if your smartphone or laptop gets good Wi-Fi reception in the area you wish to mount the camera, you likely won't have an issue.</p>

Having a large number of visible CCTV cameras in public locations might work as some level of deterrent, understanding you are being shot, though most likely not watched.</p>
