<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
