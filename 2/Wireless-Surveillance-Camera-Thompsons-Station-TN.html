<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. ADT systems are easy to use and modern. You can choose between connection types, such as landline or broadband, which will be the primary way your system is linked to ADT's network of 6 monitoring centers.

Some alarm systems use real-time audio and video monitoring technology to confirm the legitimacy of an alarm.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, since it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>
